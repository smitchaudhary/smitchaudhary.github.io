Flowers for Algernon is an emotional roller coaster, but mostly painful. Well, almost always painful.

On the literary front, it is astonishing how well of a job Daniel Keyes does in providing us a seat in Charlie Gordon's (the protagonist's) head. He takes the usual diary form of writing to the next level. Though this would qualify as science fiction, it never seems far away from reality, it is as if what he is talking about is only a few experiments away. And his fictitious world is never so hopeless that it allows you to feel not responsible for how things are around. What makes it especially painful is how you know that such treatment is not far from the truth.

I am writing this review of sorts for myself, and thus it has spoilers ahead. This book is something everyone should read. Or watch the movie I recently discovered, which is based on the book and named the same. I don't know how well a task the movie has done, neither do I know how they would have incorporated the change in writing style as Charlie's intelligence grows and diminishes. But, if you don't have the time for the book, the movie might just cut it. Though personally, I would never trade the experience of reading this book for the movie. It is the kind of book that only after you have read it, you realize what you could have missed. Highly recommended that you read the book and not read the spoilers ahead.

The story is of Charlie Gordon, an adult, but so only biologically. He is not blessed with the normal level of intelligence. But that is all to change as he is to undergo an operation. An operation that will change this fact. Charlie Gordon is going to get smart. And now is when your suffering is going to begin. The laughter which he has always seen as a sign of friendship is manifestation of mockery. The people he has always considered friends have been very mean to him. The revelations are painful and as I said above, what happens is not far from the truth, and that's something with which the author pokes at your emotions expertly. Further, as Charlie's behavior changes with growing intelligence and new-found knowledge about his friends, the people around him change their behavior as well. They can't really have an intelligent Charlie Gordon.

Another interesting thing is his bout with emotions. Charlie has his intelligence increased, but he is still a kid. A kid, trapped in an adult's body with more than an average adult's intelligence. He struggles to understand what he feels and why. He struggles to comprehend the emotions he is feeling for the first time. The amount of abuse he has been through over the years, at the hands of people at his workplace to his own mother, is not helping him either. He remembers things from his past, sometimes very unclear and if it is from his childhood, and doesn't really understand the trauma. He simply panics. He becomes so intelligent over the time that he is isolated. He becomes irritable. He is more intelligent now than the scientists who made him bright. He wants to feel human and hates being treated by the scientist as an artifact. He finds it very difficult to fit in. Anywhere.

Once Charlie's intelligence starts to fade away, as predicted by an effect he has discovered himself, the story takes a sadder turn. A turn I was not aware even existed. One thing that is commendable is his approach to life when this happens. At one point, you would feel like you want to dive into the book and console Charlie for once.

As I write this, I know it is entirely possible that I am overreacting and/or overridden by emotions as I have recently finished the book, but the book has opened the doors for me to a whole new sub-genre of both books and movies I never considered before, *Psychological Science Fiction*. Personally, I might have liked it more because I place a very high value on intelligence and I am wondering if the status quo might change.
