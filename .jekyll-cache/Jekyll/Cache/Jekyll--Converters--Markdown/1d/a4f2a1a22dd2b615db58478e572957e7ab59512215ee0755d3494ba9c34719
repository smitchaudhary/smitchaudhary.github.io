<p>As is usual for a student at graduate level, I read a bunch of academic articles, books, etc.
I have decided to write expositions/summaries for some of them where the level of detail would vary.
The motivation behind this is three-fold.
Firstly, writing it down, and having to explain something greatly enhances my level of understanding.
Moreover, for the material that I do not directly use, the details get lost on me after a while.
Thus, it is a way to expand the breadth as well as depth.
Additionally, I want to improve my (technical) writing skills, and what better way than <em>just do it</em>?</p>
