I"	<p>Hello! I am Smit Chaudhary. I am a second-year Applied Physics Masters student at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</a>. I am broadly interested in <em>Quantum Algorithms</em> and <em>Quantum Information Theory</em>. Consequently, I follow the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/applied-physics/msc-applied-physics/applied-physics-programme/track-physics-for-quantum-devices-and-quantum-computing/">Physics for Quantum Devices and Quantum Computing </a> track for my Masters. I am also interested in Classical <em>Information Theory</em> and both classical and quantum learning models. I did my Master Thesis in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/sections/quantum-circuits-architectures-and-technology/groups/quantum-machine-learning">Quantum Machine Learning</a> / <a href="https://qutech.nl/lab/feld-group/">Feld Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://sebastianfeld.de/">Prof. Sebastian Feld</a>. Currently I am doing my internship at <a href="https://www.menten.ai/">Menten AI</a> where I study different QML approaches in general and QGANs in particular.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to Delft, I graduated with a Bachelors in Physics from the <a href="http://iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IITK)</a> in 2020.</p>
