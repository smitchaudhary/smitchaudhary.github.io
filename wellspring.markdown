+ **[Prayas:](https://dora.iitk.ac.in/dora/prayas)** Prayas is a student-led initiative at IIT Kanpur where the student volunteers conduct regular classes for underprivileged children living in and around the IIT Campus. I have had the opportunity to be a part of the Prayas since January 2019.

+ **[Vox Populi:](http://voxiitk.com/)** I have been involved with Vox Populi, the student journalism body of IIT Kanpur for about 2 years now. I have served as an editor for the 2018-19 term. You can head to this [page](http://voxiitk.com/) and have a look at a part of the team's work.

+ **Books:** I mostly read non-fiction. Almost all the books I read or those on my to-read list fall into very few genres: Biographies, History of Science, and Popular Science. Though I also find some work of fiction to be captivating.

+ **Music:** I mostly have old *Gujarati Gazals* playing through my earphones. I also enjoy Rock Music.

+ **Academics' Blogs**
  + [Prof. Matthew Might's Blog:](matt.might.net/articles/) One of the reason I intend to be active on my Blog is because Prof. Matt Might argues one should. He provides insights and advice for all aspects of academic life. In addition to academic advice, he also shares advice about how to navigate through Grad School, how to work on presentation and writing skill and some general useful tips. He also shares his personal story which is heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time.
  + [Prof. Athene Donald's Blog:](http://occamstypewriter.org/athenedonald/) Prof. Donald is a Physics Professor at University of Cambridge. Her blog offers researchers' opinions and perspectives. It has guidelines for and insights into the academic life.
  + [Blecher Writing Advice:](https://wendybelcher.com/writing-advice/) This is a blog maintained by Prof. Wendy Blecher. Her advice covers technical writing and also how to read technical material. On her webpage, there is also some fascinating information about Africa and the African literature.
  + [Prof. Philip Guo's Webpage:](http://pgbovine.net/index.html) One of the best sources for practical, honest, and wide-ranging advice any undergraduate would ask for. He also has a [vlog](http://pgbovine.net/PG-Vlog-summary.htm) where he talks a lot more informally and a [podcast](http://pgbovine.net/PG-Podcast-summary.htm) where he talks to many other interesting people.

  There are many other wonderful people out there who act as the mentor we never had. There are some who provide field-specific advice as well. These are the ones I have been reading/listening to for some time now. Some of the things they say have been frightening and demotivating towards academia to be honest. But that only means I have had a false idea of what it is like out there. And whatever decisions I take, these kind *internet mentors* have had a role to play in making those the more informed ones.

+ **YouTube Channels**
  + [3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) or simply **3B1B** is the best Math Channel out there. He explains deep concepts with surprising ease and somehow manages to not dumb down stuff. There has never been a video of his I haven't learn something new and interesting from. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&feature=youtu.be) and the solution videos [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brU5yLm9DZM) blew my mind. He also has series of videos explaining the essence of Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Neural Network. Grant Sanderson is doing a great service to humankind with 3B1B.
  + [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium) is a Physics oriented channel I have been following from High School days. He generally takes this approach where he first confronts the viewer with a misconception that you could have and then explains the truth and physics behind the physical phenomena. His video on the image of the [Black Hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_GVbuddri8) really helped me understand what was going on.
  + [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2) is another one of my favorite channels out there. Destin's enthusiasm for learning is contagious. He is also very resourceful, creative and just genuinely curious. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oai7HUqncAA) is just one example how amazing his work is.
  + [PhysicsGirl](https://www.youtube.com/user/physicswoman) is a channel by Diana Cowern. This is filled with fun physics videos with nice animations and some puns thrown around here and there.
  + [StandUp Maths](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths) is a fun-filled channel where one can enjoy learning Maths while Matt Parker cracks some math jokes.
+ **Webcomics**<br>
  Lately, I have become a fan of webcomics. [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com/) is one of the most popular webcomics out there and rightly so. In addition the [What-ifs](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) are the icing on the cake.
  [Zen pencils](https://zenpencils.com/) are less frequent but the wholesome webcomics will put a smile on your face without fail. Take [this](https://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/) about Carl Sagan, [this](https://zenpencils.com/comic/curie/) about Marie and Pierre Curie, or [this](https://zenpencils.com/comic/137-richard-feynman-the-beauty-of-a-flower/) about Richard Feynman for example.
  [SMBC](www.smbc-comics.com) or Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal is another popular webcomic that I like.
  [The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com/) is a fantastic webcomic with posts that are sometimes very silly and funny and sometimes long and thoughtful. Other webcomics I like are [Cyanide & Happiness](http://explosm.net/) and [Extra Ordinary](https://www.exocomics.com/).
