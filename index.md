Hello! I am Smit Chaudhary. I am a second-year Applied Physics Masters student at the [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I am broadly interested in *Quantum Algorithms* and *Quantum Information Theory*. Consequently, I follow the [Physics for Quantum Devices and Quantum Computing ](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/applied-physics/msc-applied-physics/applied-physics-programme/track-physics-for-quantum-devices-and-quantum-computing/) track for my Masters. I am also interested in Classical *Information Theory* and both classical and quantum learning models. I did my Master Thesis in the [Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/sections/quantum-circuits-architectures-and-technology/groups/quantum-machine-learning) / [Feld Group](https://qutech.nl/lab/feld-group/) under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Feld](https://sebastianfeld.de/). Currently I am doing my internship at [Menten AI](https://www.menten.ai/) where I study different QML approaches in general and QGANs in particular.

Prior to coming to Delft, I graduated with a Bachelors in Physics from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IITK)](http://iitk.ac.in/) in 2020.

## Research Interests

Quantum Algorithms, Quantum-classical hybrid optimization, Quantum Machine Learning

## Publication

[Towards a scalable discrete quantum generative adversarial neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13993)


[**CV**](/assets/pdfs/CV.pdf)

  + At [blog](/blog/), I write about a variety of topics. You can find some of my academic related writings as well as non-academic stff
  + At [readings](/readings/), I write exposition/summary for some of the papers/books that I read. This tilts a lot more on the academic side than not.
  + At [projects](/projects/), I summarize the projects that I have undertaken and what I have learnt through those. It includes past academic and work related projects as well as some simply fun endeavors.
