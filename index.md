Hello! I am Smit Chaudhary. A physicist, ML Developer, and a full-time nerd. I enjoy training large neural networks to get them to solve problems they have not seen before.

## What I've Been Up To

- **[PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/)** - **Machine Learning ü§ù Quantum Computing**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Built Scientific ML systems. Trained Neural Networks. Minimized losses. Shipped APIs that let others use our Quantum Neural Networks to minimize their losses.*</span>
- **[Menten AI](https://www.menten.ai/)** - **Research Intern**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Built Generative Adversarial Networks in JAX. Made them quantum. Taught them discrete data. Published the results.*</span>
- **[TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/)** - **Master's in Applied Physics**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Built optimization algorithms in [Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/sections/quantum-circuits-architectures-and-technology/groups/quantum-machine-learning) group. Implemented GANs for quantum states. Researched barren plateaus. Learned Physics. Applied Physics.*</span>
- **[IIT Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/)** - **Bachelor's in Physics**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Learned a lot. Forgot a lot. Learned to learn again. Learned to forget only some. Still reaping the benefits of those fundamentals.*</span>

## More About Me

- <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Grew up in India, now live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.*</span>
- **Stop-Motion Animation**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*I enjoy the process of meticulously crafting each frame where hours worth of effort bears a small (often satisfying) few-seconds long clip.*</span>
- **Open Source**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Always looking for open source alternatives to everything. Yes, everything. And you should also sponsor your favorite open source projects. Goes a long way.*</span>
- **Build From Scratch**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Building something from ground up is my usual way of, uhm, scratching the itch. Not just now on weekend(s) projects but also during academic projects.*</span>
- **I Self-Host by the way**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*Ok. I am not annoying about it (yet) but I am starting to move more and more of my stuff off someone else's cloud and my own VPS. [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) and [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) for the win.*</span>
- **Languages and Etymology**<br>
  <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*I am fortunate to be part of a diverse set of friends, which means many discussions about the similarities and differences in our languages. Have many unfounded theories.*</span>
