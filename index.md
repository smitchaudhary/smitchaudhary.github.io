Hello! I am Smit Chaudhary. A physicist, quantum algorithm developer, and a full-time nerd. Currently I work as a Quantum Algorithm Developer at [PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/) where I get to work at the intersection of Quantum Computing and Machine Learning.

I did my Masters in Applied Physics at the [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) in the Physics for Quantum Devices and Quantum Computing track. In Delft, I did my Master Thesis in the [Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/sections/quantum-circuits-architectures-and-technology/groups/quantum-machine-learning) / [Feld Group](https://qutech.nl/lab/feld-group/) under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Feld](https://sebastianfeld.de/) where I researched novel quantum walk based algorithm for qubit mapping problem.

I did my internship at [Menten AI](https://www.menten.ai/) where I studied different QML approaches in general and QGANs in particular. We looked into developing a discrete QGAN.

Prior to coming to Delft, I graduated with a Bachelors in Physics from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IITK)](http://iitk.ac.in/) in 2020.

I grew up in India and enjoy the company of a diverse friends group. I often conjure up new absolutely unfounded theories about linguistics based on the similarities and difference I find in different languages that my friends speak. I also enjoy the long process of stop-motion animation that bears a small, often satisfying video clip. I spend way too much time looking for viable open source alternatives for all softwares that I need.

## Research Interests

Quantum Algorithms, Quantum-classical hybrid optimisation, Quantum Machine Learning

## Publication

[Towards a scalable discrete quantum generative adversarial neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13993)

  + At [blog](/blog/), I write about a variety of topics. You can find some of my academic related writings as well as non-academic stuff
  + At [readings](/readings/), I write exposition/summary for some of the papers/books that I read. This tilts a lot more on the academic side than not.
  + At [projects](/projects/), I summarise the projects that I have undertaken and what I have learnt through those. It includes past academic and work related projects as well as some simply fun endeavours.
