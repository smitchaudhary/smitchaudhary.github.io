        <b><q>A combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity and raging chutzpah.</q></b>
          <p><a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.amazon.in/Surely-youre-Joking-Feynman-Adventures/dp/009917331X">Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman</a> proves to be a riveting read. The book is so fun it is unputdownable.
            Before I laud this book without a break, I think a disclaimer is due. Richard Feynman is one of my faviorite people to have walked on the face of this planet.
            He is one my scientific heroes. So I think it is only understandable that I would have adored a lot of things in the books that you might find plain and ordinary.
          <p> But don't allow the above disclaimer to undermine how amusing this book is. Richard Feynman genuinely loves Physics and questions everything.
            I often catch myself trying to think about something the way Feynman would have. And the chances of me matching the thoughts of a generational scientist are meagre, if any, but the exercise is almost always fruitful.
            He simplifies <strong>everything</strong>.
          <p>You will almost always will find yourself questioning <i>How can these many interesting things happen to a person?</i> So did I. But I think the answer lies in the fact that Feynman is very observant and curios and the fact that he needs to <i>understand</i> it and not just <i>know</i> it.
            The book makes this clear from the word go. The fact that a dinasour was a certain metres high was not enough. He was made to understand that it would mean the dinosour would reach his window.
            And you will have similar instances scattered in the book.
            <p>One critique I have constantly heard of this book is that Feynman is too full of himself. Firstly, the book is about Feynman. And he is curios and energetic and excited about new discoveries and results (let them be his or someone else's).
              This excitement might come out as him being too full of himself. Apart from this, one needs to remember that the book is adaptation of conversations and talks and thus some sloppy errors which might exhibit ego can be ignored (if not forgiven).
            <p>Another objection, which I too have, is Feynman's sexism. Women are always <i>pretty girls</i> to him. For his time, that might be the norm, but one can't deny that a few things were sexist. And though that might be <i>OK</i> to people back then, it in no way should be so today.
            <p>If I am feeling down, I often think of Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman.
              Two of my greates heroes who at some point thought they didn't amount to much.
              I might not be Feynman or Einstein but I feel if I keep my shit together, I might just be able to do something worthwhile.
              This book albeit briefly, takes you to those parts of Feynman's life as well.
            <p>Overall, it is a gripping read and is very easy to read as the story, just like Feynman, hardly ever ceases to amaze you.
